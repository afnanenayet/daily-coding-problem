# Daily Coding Problem Solutions

These are my solutions to the Daily Coding Problem mailing list. Solutions are
written in Python 3.X and test cases are tested using `pytest`. Each problem
has their own python file, which is named after the numeric identifier for the
problem (i.e. Problem #1 corresponds to `1.py`).

## Running

I can't guarantee that I'll always provide a complete solution to these
problems, but I'll try to present fully coded solutions that actually run. To
run the test cases for a particular problem, use `pytest`:

```
pytest 520.py
```

I use `black` for code formatting.
